    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pre-made pie crusts (for top and bottom)</li>
        <li>6 large apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced (use a mix of sweet and tart varieties for best flavor)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>Vanilla ice cream for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the Pie Crust: Roll out one of the pie crusts and line a 9-inch pie dish with it. Trim any excess dough from the edges.</li>
        <li>Mix the Filling: In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice. Toss until the apples are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Fill the Pie: Transfer the apple mixture into the prepared pie crust, spreading it out evenly. Dot the top with pieces of unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>Top the Pie: Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the filling. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie.</li>
        <li>Ventilate: Use a sharp knife to make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Cool: Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slice the pie into wedges and serve warm or at room temperature. Top each slice with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream.</li>
